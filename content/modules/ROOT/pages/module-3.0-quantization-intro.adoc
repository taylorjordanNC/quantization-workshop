= Module 4: Model Quantization

== Introduction

Having gotten a taste of benchmarking and a basic understanding of how you can optimize your vLLM performance, it's time to tackle the most impactful optimization technique: model quantization. This module teaches you to compress LLM weights and activations to dramatically reduce memory requirements and inference costs while preserving model quality.

Quantization is transformative because it addresses the fundamental challenge of modern LLMs: their massive size. By reducing numerical precision from 16-bit to 8-bit or 4-bit representations, you can achieve 50-75% memory reduction, enabling deployment on smaller hardware and significant cost savings.

Why quantization matters:

* **Cost Reduction**: Deploy larger models on less expensive hardware, reducing infrastructure costs by 2-4X
* **Memory Efficiency**: Fit models that previously required multiple GPUs onto single GPU deployments  
* **Inference Speed**: Reduced data movement and optimized compute paths can improve throughput
* **Democratization**: Make state-of-the-art models accessible to organizations with limited GPU budgets

== Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

* Understand quantization fundamentals: weights, activations, and precision trade-offs
* Implement W4A16 and W8A8 quantization schemes using LLM Compressor
* Apply advanced techniques like SmoothQuant and GPTQ for optimal accuracy preservation
* Build automated quantization pipelines using OpenShift AI and evaluate compressed models
* Make informed decisions about quantization schemes based on hardware and use case requirements
