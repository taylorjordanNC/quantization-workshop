=== Challenges with running larger models

Even with the latest hardware like NVIDIA B200 GPUs offering up to 192GB of memory, the rapid increase in model sizes (e.g., GPT MoE 1.8T parameters) means that many state-of-the-art models cannot fit into a single GPU or even across multiple GPUs without optimization.

=== What optimized models offer:

* **Reduces GPU Memory requirements**
** Model parameters account for the majority of GPU RAM usage at typical sequence lengths.
** Optimization allows you to allocate more memory to the KV cache, enabling longer context windows or larger batch sizes.

* **Accelerates linear layers**
** Minimizes data movement, which is a major bottleneck in large models.
** Enables the use of low-precision tensor cores (as supported by the underlying hardwares), significantly speeding up matrix multiplications and inference.

* **Maintains model quality**
** Fine-grained quantization techniques can compress models with minimal or negligible impact on accuracy, preserving performance while reducing resource needs.

Below is an example of the DeepSeek R1 model, showing how different quantization methods impact evaluation results after compression. It's important to note that not all quantization methods are equal and model quality can vary significantly depending on the quantization scheme used. So, it's important to consider the impact on accuracy when choosing a quantization scheme.

In addition to the improvements described above, it also offers the following advantages:

* **Cost efficiency**: Running large models requires expensive hardware. By optimizing and compressing models, you can reduce the required resources, leading to significant cost savings in both cloud and on-premise deployments.

* **Faster inference**: Smaller, optimized models can process requests faster, reducing latency and improving user experience, especially in real-time applications.

* **Energy efficiency**: Compressing models reduces the computational load, which in turn lowers power consumption and helps meet sustainability goals.

* **Deployment flexibility**: Optimized models are easier to deploy on a wider range of devices, including edge devices and environments with limited resources.

* **Scalability**: Smaller models allow you to serve more concurrent users or run more instances on the same hardware, improving scalability.

* **Bandwidth savings**: Transferring large models over the network can be slow and costly. Compressed models are smaller and easier to distribute.

* **Regulatory and security constraints**: Cases where data and models must remain on-premise or on specific hardware, optimization enables running advanced models within these constraints.

* **Enabling new use cases**: By reducing the size and resource requirements, model optimization makes it feasible to use advanced LLMs in scenarios previously not possible, such as mobile, IoT, or embedded systems.

=== Supported quantization methods/recipies and when to use what?

[cols="1,3,3", options="header"]
|===
| Method | Description | Use case / Accuracy needs

| GPTQ
| Utilizes second-order layer-wise optimizations to prioritize important weights/activations and enables updates to remaining weights
| High accuracy recovery; best for scenarios where accuracy is critical and longer quantization time is acceptable

| AWQ
| Uses channelwise scaling to better preserve important outliers in weights and activations
| Moderate accuracy recovery; suitable when faster quantization is needed with reasonable accuracy

| SmoothQuant
| Smooths outliers in activations by folding them into weights, ensuring better accuracy for weight and activation quantized models
| Good accuracy recovery with minimal calibration time; can be combined with other methods for efficiency

| SparseGPT	
| One‑shot pruning method that solves layer‑wise sparse regression to set weights to zero while readjusting survivors; supports unstructured sparsity up to ≈ 50–60 % without any retraining and 2 : 4 semi‑structured (N:M) sparsity for hardware‑friendly acceleration; can be stacked with low‑bit quantization	
| When latency/throughput or memory footprint must drop quickly and some accuracy loss is acceptable: 2 : 4 mode on Hopper/Blackwell‑class GPUs for ~1.5–2× speed‑up with near‑AWQ accuracy on large‑scale models; small models (<7 B) may see noticeable drops

=== Let's help a client select the quantization method and scheme

[cols="1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Question
| Example client answer
| How the client's answer drives the decision

| **1. Inference style**  
Is the workload **online** (latency‑critical, interactive) or **offline** (throughput‑critical, batch)?
| *e.g. “online customer‑service chatbot”*
| • **Online** ⇒ Memory‑bandwidth bound ⇒ **Weight‑only quantization** (activations stay FP16).  
• **Offline** ⇒ Compute bound ⇒ **Weight + activation quantization** (both operands low‑precision).

| **2. Target GPU architecture**
| *e.g. “Ampere A100”*
| • **Turing/Ampere** have INT8 Tensor Cores ⇒ pick INT8 for speeds.  
• **Hopper/H100** have native FP8 ⇒ pick FP8 (or INT8 if tooling is simpler).

| **3. Expected concurrency / batch size**  
Enough requests to saturate matrix‑mult units?
| *e.g. “≈5 concurrent users; GPU often idle”*
| • If GPU **not fully busy**, you gain more by cutting **memory traffic** (weight‑only).  
• If GPU **fully busy**, you gain more by lowering **compute cost** (weight + activation).

| **4. Accuracy head‑room / SLA**  
“How much accuracy can I lose?”
| *e.g. “<0.5 pp drop allowed”*
| Tight budgets push you toward higher‑accuracy methods (GPTQ, SmoothQuant + GPTQ).

=== Example decision cheat sheet
[cols="1,1,1,2", options="header"]
|===
| Chosen answers
| Quantization scheme
| Recommended method(s)
| Why this combination?

| *Online*, Ampere/Turing, few users, strict latency
| W4 / W8 – A16 (weight-only)
| AWQ (fast), or GPTQ (max accuracy)
| Data-movement is the bottleneck; compute is "free". Weight-only avoids per-token FP16→INT8 converts on activations.

| *Online*, Hopper, few users
| W4 / W8 – A16 weight-only (still)
| AWQ or GPTQ
| Hopper can run FP8 activations, but if users are few, activation traffic is tiny—stick to weight-only.

| *Offline*, Ampere/Turing, large batch
| W8 – A8 (INT8/INT8)
| SmoothQuant + GPTQ (fold activation outliers, then weight-quant)
| Matrix-multiplication dominates; lowering both operands to INT8 doubles Tensor-Core throughput.

| *Offline*, Hopper, massive batch
| W8 – A8 or FP8/FP8
| SmoothQuant + SparseGPT (optional pruning)
| Hopper’s FP8 Tensor Cores peak at ~2× A100 throughput. SmoothQuant tames activation outliers; SparseGPT can prune 2:4 (semi-structured) for more speed.

=== Quantization workflow
image::quantization_flow.png[quantization_flow]

* Model selection and loading
[source,python]
----
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("your-model")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("your-model")
----

* Choosing the quantization scheme (<<_supported_quantization_schemes_when_to_use_what,Supported quantization schemes>>)
* Choosing the quantization method (<<_supported_quantization_methods_recipies_and_when_to_use_what,Supported quantization methods>>)
* Preparing calibration data

** Ensure the calibration data contains a high variety of samples to prevent overfitting towards a specific use case.
** If the model was fine-tuned, use the sample datasets from the fine-tuning training data for calibration.
** Employ the chat template or instruction template that the model was trained with.
** Start with 512 samples for calibration data, and increase if accuracy drops.
** Use a sequence length of 2048 as a starting point.
** Tune key hyperparameters to the quantization algorithm:
*** `dampening_frac` sets how much influence the GPTQ algorithm has. Lower values can improve accuracy, but can lead to numerical instabilities that cause the algorithm to fail.
*** `actorder` sets the activation ordering. When compressing the weights of a layer, the order in which channels are quantized matters. Setting `actorder="weight"` can improve accuracy without added latency.

* Applying quantization

** After preparing your calibration data and tuning the key quantization hyperparameters, the next step is to actually apply quantization to your model. The recommended and most reliable way to do this is by using the **oneshot** API provided by LLM Compressor. This approach ties together all the previous steps—model loading, calibration and quantization—into a single, reproducible workflow driven by a recipe file. 

=== Oneshot Quantization

The **oneshot** entrypoint in LLM Compressor provides a streamlined, recipe-driven approach to quantization. It applies a pre-defined quantization method (such as GPTQ, AWQ, or SmoothQuant) to a model in a single step, using a calibration dataset and configuration specified in the recipe. Technically, oneshot:

* Loads the model and calibration data
* Applies the quantization method as defined in the recipe (e.g., GPTQ for weight quantization, SmoothQuant for activation smoothing)
* Calibrates quantization parameters (scales, zero points) in one pass
* Exports the quantized model for deployment

This approach ensures reproducibility and minimizes the risk of accuracy loss, as all parameters and steps are controlled by the recipe. **Do not attempt manual or custom quantization without a validated recipe.**

Shown below is an example of how to use oneshot API and provide the recipies to quantize and/or apply sparsity to the model given a dataset
