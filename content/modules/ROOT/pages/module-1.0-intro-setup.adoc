= Module 1: Deploying your model with vLLM on OpenShift AI

== Introduction

This module covers deploying a Gen AI model with vLLM as the inference runtime on an OpenShift AI cluster.

== Learning Objectives

- Deploy vLLM across three enterprise platforms
- Understand platform-specific configuration requirements
- Compare deployment architectures and operational trade-offs
- Establish foundation for performance evaluation and optimization

== Prerequisites

- Access to target deployment environments
- Basic familiarity with containers and Kubernetes concepts
- Understanding of LLM serving requirements

== Preparing our environment

You currently are working with an OpenShift cluster with OpenShift AI deployed on top of that kubernetes cluster. We have one GPU node. 

=== Deploying MinIO

**Create a Data Science Project where we will deploy MinIO**

1. In the Red Hat OpenShift AI user interface, create a data science project.
2. Simply navigate to Data Science Projects
3. Click Create Project
4. Name the project `minio`. Ensure the resource name field matches.

**Go back to OpenShift Console**

image::openshift.console.png[]

1. Make sure you're in the administrator view, not the developer view.
2. Go to workloads, then pods, and confirm the selected project is correct.

3. You now have a project, otherwise known as a namespace, to deploy MinIO.

**Deploy MinIO**

1. Click on the +("Import YAML") button.

2. Paste the following YAML into the box.

=== Creating Buckets in MinIO

**Log into MinIO**

1. Locate the minio-ui Route, and open its location URL in a web browser:

2. When prompted, log in

* user: minio
* pass: minio123

3. You should now be logged into your MinIO instance.

**Create buckets**

1. Click on **create a bucket**

2. Name the first one `models`. Click create bucket.

3. Create a second bucket named `pipelines`. Click create bucket.

We will use these buckets during the workshop.
