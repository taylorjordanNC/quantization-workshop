= Conclusion: From Evaluation to Impact

== Why Evaluation Matters in Production

Model evaluation isn’t just a checkbox—it’s the foundation for building robust, responsible, and scalable GenAI systems.

These evaluations aren't theoretical—they directly support:

* **Model selection**: Does it meet your task and performance goals?

* **Deployment readiness**: Can it serve real users under load?

* **Risk mitigation**: Will it behave reliably in edge cases?

== Bringing This to Your Workflow

Ask yourself these questions as you move forward with production LLM systems:

- Have you validated latency and throughput under realistic input/output patterns?

- Can you track regression and improvement over time as you iterate?

Whether you're fine-tuning a foundation model, deploying a RAG pipeline, or designing agentic workflows - evaluation is your grounding signal.
